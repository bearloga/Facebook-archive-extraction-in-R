R script[s] to extract data from archives that Facebook allows its users to download.

Open your account settings and click on the download a copy of your Facebook data link there to get to the following page.

A couple of hours later you'll receive an email with the link to download the zipped archive.

Unzip into some directory ('facebook data' for me). Of interest is 'wall.html' in the 'html' subdirectory. You can open it and check it out. We'll use it.
